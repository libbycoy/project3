# Firearms in the US & Australia | Infographic in the Browser
#### By Libby Coy

[Live Site](http://aus-usa.herokuapp.com/)

#### Overview

I created an animated infographic in the browser about firearm statistics in the US and Australia. I have created a lot of infographics as a graphic designer and wanted to make one in the browser through code. It is a Rails app written in HTML, CSS, jQuery and a little bit of Ruby. I used the Chartjs library to create most of the graphs. I particularly enjoyed creating the bubble graphs which animate on click and display the differing rates of homocide and suicide gun deaths by firearm per 100,000 people in the US and Australia. The app also features a live voting system at the bottom which only allows users to vote once and uses Ajax to display results instantly.

#### Known Bugs / "Features"
* Parallax section with quote is buggy ðŸ¤”
* Graph scales need to be fixed on the line graph.

#### TODO
* Graph scales need to be fixed on the line graph.
* Bubble graph sections need polishing
* Parallax section with quote needs to be fixed
